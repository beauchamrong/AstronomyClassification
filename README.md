# Astronomy Image Classification
Date : 03/04/2023
The aim of this project is to classify images of galaxies and nebulae using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it was my first using trying image classification and using CNNs.

## Dataset
The data used in this project was retrieved from NASA's public image archive from the following link https://images.nasa.gov/. The images were preprocessed to ensure that they were all the same size and format.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- os
- pip._vendor.requests
- glob
- cv2
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas


## Results
An accuracy of X% was achieved

## Credits
This project was created by Beauchamrong TAN as a personal side project. The images were retrieved  from NASA's public image archive, and the CNN model was developed using TensorFlow.
